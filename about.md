I'm Alex Good. I founded a tech company called Perpetua this year. Our goal is to democratize advertising technology, and turn digital advertising itself into an a commodity just like oil that is tradeable on exchanges, and used as small-business stimulus by world governments. 

Previously I've been at hedge funds doing long/short equity investing, and at software companies building investing strategies based on big data. 

I'm writing this blog to talk about:

* Advertising
* Life Hacking
* Financial Markets
* Goals
