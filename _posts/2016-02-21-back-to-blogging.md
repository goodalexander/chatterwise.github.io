summary:    my return to blogging, staying humble, predicting digital megatrends

I'm not sure you've ever been down the web time machine, [Web Time Machine](https://archive.org/web/.)  But it can be informative, and depressing - the same way finding childhood photos when you're home for Christmas can be. Some mix of horror at what a clown you once were, and wistfulness at the potential you had and subsequently squandered. Behold Priceline.com's website in 1997:

I'm the type of person to reinvent myself digitally ever few years, then delete all traces of it to comply with my company's "social media policy". I don't want to be the guy who gets fired for writing a play by play summary of his -- okay, well, use your imagination. All of my 1997 Priceline.com's are long gone, but... 

### Highlights of past digital lives: 

  1. Chronicled the financial crisis in a series of Wall Street Journal summaries, pitching myself as a financial expert and wearing a Men's Warehouse suit in a very serious looking stock photograph.
  2. Started a social media consulting business which was later shut down, resulting in the firing of 6 unpaid employees.
  3. Started a miniature hedge fund which was closed due to lack of funding, but had a great blog.
  4. Crafted a diet entirely made of low-sugar Kefir and Go-Lean cereal that resulted in extreme fat loss. The local grocery store was routinely out of Kefir after my step-by-step guide gained a strange cult following
  5. Advised colleagues to engage in meditation and hypnosis before such suggestions were commonplace. I still like to imagine Ray Dalio was reading my blog, 'hmm yes this young man has it all figured out.'

One benefit of the [Web Time Machine](https://archive.org/web/.) is caching your predictions. It was amazing back in 2008 that a random college student reading the WSJ could see the writing on the wall:

### wild predictions were made, total stimulus understimated by trillions... but still!

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The market’s sensitivity to news about the government bailing out bond insurers tells me that the market has entered extremely volatile territory. There is already significant debate over plans for an economic stimulus akin to Bush’s 2001 stimulus package. Government bail out of bond insurers could be similarly deadlocked. Additionally, some analysts have predicted that bond insurers would need $200 billion worth of capital injections to stay afloat. This number simply is not within the range of potential government aid. Bush’s entire proposed stimulus package, including tax rebates, is for only $150 billion. Because bond insurers just will not be able to gather the requisite funds to maintain their triple-A credit ratings, they will lose their business, and cause massive write downs all across the financial industry. Goodbriefs.com predicts serious damage to the financial sector.

### Time for the NEW grand prediction, Lifestyle-as-a-Service 

My younger brasher self concerned himself with predicting global financial contagion, but I won't do that here. Instead, I'll make a prediction relevant to digital self-expression, this blog, and the company I've started this year. I think 2016 is the beginning of a mega-trend, that's only just beginning. Lifestyle as a Services. LAAS. People like Tai Lopez and Tim Ferriss were the earlier adopters, but it's fairly clear that they're just replicating the Tony Robbins Playbook of massively overpromising and selling seminars and advice. The tools you need to become a Tim Ferriss or Tai Lopez are increasingly commoditized and accessible via Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and there've never been more affiliate programs by which to monetize personal relationships. 

##### Some attributes of Lifestyle as a Service: 

  * <span class="red">Grocery cart consumption.</span>  I predict that people will begin sharing their entire diets with eachother and celebrities will charge fees to do so. 
  * <span class="red">Workout replication.</span> I predict Fitbit integration with video will create new local fitness brands and gurus that also share grocery carts (protein etc)
  * <span class="red">Coursera/ Lynda.com/ Git understudying.</span> I predict that people will begin building personal brands around all the courses they've taken. What did Sunder Pichai learn about this week? etc.
  * <span class="red">Fashion.</span> Well dressed people will begin monetizing their photo blogs by sharing their entire wardrobes with subscription fashion services such as Trunk Club 
  * <span class="red">Recruiting.</span> Soon, people will daisy chain on eachothers' recruiting behavior - i.e. automatically submit for an interview every time one of my friends does.
  * <span class="red">Investment strategy replication.</span> This is already an (obscure) service to some extent of Interactive Brokers, and might take longer due to regulation to catch - but ultimately I predict successful traders will manage large numbers of random accounts with lower fees than a hedge fund structure but substanially less overhead and tax protection
